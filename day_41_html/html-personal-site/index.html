    <h1>Brian Mendes</h1>
    <p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-mendes-cpa/">Data Scientist</a> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/btwmendes">Life-long Learner</a></strong></em></p>
    <p>I am a solution-driven data scientist with a dedication to life-long learning. My experience in public accounting,
    national distribution of ice cream, and leadership/management at a private school has given me a strong business
    background, along with a data-focused approach. I have been working with SQL for 5+ years and recently broadened my
    programming experience by learning Python and its related libraries. I practice a discipline for the details because
    the best stories are often about the things overlooked.</p>
